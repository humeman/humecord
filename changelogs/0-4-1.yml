  This update fixes ~~all~~ some of the things I missed before the release of 0.4.0.
changes:
  - name: Bug fixes
    value: |
      - Fixed a bug in which the message command handler set arguments even when not supplied by the user
      - Fixed an error that prevented role validation from working in message commands
      - Fixed a bug that caused any user-facing errors to not be sent in message commands
      - Fixed a bug that caused the message command handler to return a syntax error if the command has only one subcommand
  - name: Updated the docs, a lot
    value: |
      There is now a full guide available on how to set up and use Humecord -- installation, making a bot, and setting it up with Humecord.
      There are also a number of guides on commands, loops, events, components, API usage, the messenger, and so on. More will be added shortly.

      All classes have full doc coverage now. Utils are in the works.
  - name: Added docstrings and type definitions to a bunch of functions
    value: |
      Anything in the docs is also available as a docstring now. Try hovering over a function name in VSCode.
      This is in preparation for an update in the near future in which type checking will be enabled.
  - name: Re-added all missing commands
    value: |
      At release, Humecord 0.4 was missing the base commands `/dev`, `/logs`, `/messages`, `/overrides`, `/syslogger`, and `/useredit`. They have been readded.

    value: |
      It now contains some components that allow you to view commands, events, and loops.
