description: |
  This update fixes ~~all~~ a few of the things I missed before the release of 0.4.0.
changes:
  - name: Bug fixes
    value: |
      - Fixed a bug in which the message command handler set arguments even when not supplied by the user
      - Fixed an error that prevented role validation from working in message commands
      - Fixed a bug that caused any user-facing errors to not be sent in message commands
      - Fixed a bug that caused the message command handler to return a syntax error if the command has only one subcommand
      - Fixed a bug that prevented args from being parsed correctly in no-subcommand message commands
      - Fixed a bug in the message command handler that got UDBs from users that don't exist
      - Fixed a bug in `/exec run` which swapped around `resp` and `ctx`
      - Fixed a bug that prevented message replies from being handled as commands
      - Fixed a bug in the permanent interaction receiver that prevented args from being parsed 
      - Fixed a bug that prevented command execution in news channels
      - Removed an older `miscutils.get_duration()` function which behaved incorrectly - use `dateutils.get_duration()`
      - Fixed a bug that prevented checking for additional command matches if another command name was contained at the end of the first arg
  - name: Changed some interaction manager/command handler behaviors
    value: |
      - Internal component names are no longer restricted to alphanumeric characters only
      - The character limit for internal names has been increased to 30
  - name: Updated the docs, a lot
    value: |
      There is now a full guide available on how to set up and use Humecord -- installation, making a bot, and setting it up with Humecord.
      There are also a number of guides on commands, loops, events, components, API usage, the messenger, and so on. More will be added shortly.

      All classes have full doc coverage now. Utils are in the works.
  - name: Added docstrings and type definitions to a bunch of functions
    value: |
      Anything in the docs is also available as a docstring now. Try hovering over a function name in VSCode.
      This is in preparation for an update in the near future in which type checking will be enabled.
  - name: Re-added all missing commands
    value: |
      At release, Humecord 0.4 was missing the base commands `/dev`, `/logs`, `/messages`, `/overrides`, `/syslogger`, and `/useredit`. They have been readded.
  - name: Updated the client ready message
    value: |
      It now contains some components that allow you to view commands, events, and loops.
  - name: Added dev permission overrides
    value: By default, if a user has the `bot.dev` permission they will pass permission checks for any permission node. A config option for this will be added shortly. You can also disable this behavior in manual permission checks by setting the `dev_override` kwarg to `False`.
