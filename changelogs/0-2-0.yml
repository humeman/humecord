title: Settings Update
description: This update adds a number of features which make configuring your bot from Discord and parsing user input easier. 
changes:
  - name: Added an argument parser
    value: Accessible via `bot.args`, this argument parser allows you to easily validate and parse user input in any form. It's fully customizable, and will now be in use in several areas of HumeCord - the new settings command, configuration validation, and (soon) automatic command argument validation.

  - name: Added !settings
    value: This command allows you to let users configure your bot, from discord - without the need to make a bunch of commands for each setting. Configured entirely in config.yml (check for `settings` and `settings_categories`).
