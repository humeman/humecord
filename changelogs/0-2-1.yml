  Quick refresher update for Humecord 0.2, with a couple quality of life updates and improvements.

changes:
  - name: Updated utils
    value: utils.miscutils, utils.discordutils, and utils.dateutils have all received some updates. Particularly, more ways to parse and format dates/times, as well as improved dict searching features. These are being added to make way for the upcoming music extension.
  - name: Fixed bugs from 0.2
    value: A number of bugs that were introduced in Humecord 0.2 have now been patched - mostly in the realm of the new commands (!help, !botban, etc).
  - name: Added decorator events
    value: |
      This allows you to define functions to run on specific events, on the fly.

      For example:
      ```py
      @humecord.event("on_ready", priority = 10)
      async def ready(*args):
          print("Bot is ready!")
      ```

      More ways to interact with Humecord like this will be introduced in a future update.
