## Support
You can get any support you need with developing using Humecord, as well as help with using my own bots, in the [HumeBots discord](https://discord.gg/nhaRXY28Yn).

Feel free to create an issue here if you believe you found an issue or improvement in the code itself.

And, head over to the Discussions tab for any Humecord-related question if you don't want to use the discord.

## Extensions
You can find details on implementing StatusReporter support, which is my monitoring bot for any Humecord instance, at:
* the [humeman/statusreporter](https://github.com/humeman/statusreporter) github repo
* the docs: [docs/misc/status](docs/misc/status.md)

Info on creating a Humecord compatible API and websocket is listed at [docs/interfaces](docs/interfaces).

You can, alternatively, create your own interface to support whatever storage system you use. Learn more [here](docs/interfaces/create.md).
